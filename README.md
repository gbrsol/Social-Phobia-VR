# Social-Phobia-VR
 A Social Phobia Treatment System using Virtual Reality with A-Frame, Node.JS and MongoDB.
 
 All characters' 3D models were taken from Mixamo and are stored locally due to Github's 100MB restriction.
 Most of the scenes were made using SweetHome3D and some of the objects were taken from TurboSquid, Sketchfab and CGTrader.
